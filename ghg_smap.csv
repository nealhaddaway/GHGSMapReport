With CT, the residue (≈3 tonnes ha_1) from the previous season's crop was left undisturbed over the autumn and winter period. Herbicide (glyphosate 3 l ha_1 of a 360 g product) was applied in January or early February to control over-wintering weeds and volunteer barley seedlings. The soil was inverted by ploughing to a depth of approximately 220 mm, generally in February or early March (depending on weather and soil conditions) from one to five weeks prior to sowing the crop (Table 1). The RT–CC management system began with a shallow (approx. 75 mm) non-inversion cultivation involving one passwith a tined stubble cultivator (Horsch Terrano FX) from mid to late August followed by rolling to encourage moisture conservation and volunteer growth (Table 1). Following a period of two to three weeks, the area was sprayed with glyphosate (1.08 kg ha_1) and the mustard cover crop (cv. ‘Rivona’ in 2008 and 2009; ‘Sunshine’ in 2010) was sown two days later using a cultivator drill (Vaderstad Rapide) at a seeding rate of 13 kg ha_1. The cover crop was sprayed with glyphosate herbicide in January to early February to ensure the vegetation had sufficient time to decay before sowing the spring barley crop. Both CT and RT–CC plots were sown with spring barley in March with a cultivator drill (Vaderstad Rapide) — the exact date depending on weather conditions and soil moisture content. The CT plots were rolled prior to sowing and all plots were rolled after sowing (Table 1). Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied in accordance with recommendations based on soil nutrient status (Coulter and Lalor, 2008). Fertilizer N was applied at a rate of 63 kg N ha_1 at growth stage 12 (GS: Zadoks decimal scale), and subsequently another 72 kg N ha_1 was applied at GS 21–30, to give a total of 135 kg N ha_1 (Table 1).

 through two Tefl on tubes (each 12.5 m long) attached to two sampling
 ports installed atop the chamber. Consistent with the fi ndings of
 Flechard et al. (2005), we found the instrument to overestimate N2O
 concentrations due to high CO2 and water vapor concentrations during
 chamber deployment (data not shown). To solve this problem, N2O and
 CO2 were measured separately and N2O was measured by forcing the
 gas sample pumped from the chamber to the instrument through a soda
 lime fi lter to eliminate almost all CO2 (concentration <40 _L L_1). To
 equilibrate the water vapor concentration identically across all N2O
 samples, they were then bubbled in 400 mL of deionized water maintained
 at 18°C. Nitrous oxide dissolution in the water did not infl uence
 the fl ux estimations since we calculated the N2O dissolved to be
 in the range of six orders of magnitude lower than that in the chamber
 headspace.","infrared gas analyzer; Internal chamber gas concentrations were measured

 30 cm, 8 cm deep, with a 2 cm wide horizontal
 flange at the
 top end, were inserted into the soil so that the
 flange rested on the
 soil surface. Four pairs of chambers were installed at regular
 intervals in the direction of the irrigation water
 flow starting near
 the head end (water input) of the
 field in order to capture any
 potential gradients caused by the irrigation
 flow (Rochette et al.,

 were installed, one parallel and another one perpendicular to the
 plant rows, in order to ensure representative sampling of the inter-
 row areas.","Gas samples were analyzed within two weeks of collection on a

Cameron et al. (1992). Briefly, steel casings (50 cm diameter _ 70 cm depth) were pushed
into the soil in small increments, while the surrounding soil was gently scraped away,
leaving an undisturbed soil column within the casing. The edges of the soil column were sealed to the casing using molten petroleumjelly, to prevent edge flow effects. The lysimeters
were then installed in a lysimeter facility, level with the surrounding soil. The outside of the
lysimeters were back-filled to maintain the climatic conditions of the surrounding field.
The lysimeters were planted with the fodder crop kale (Brassica oleracea cv. Regal L.) in
January 2011. After germination, the kale plants were thinned to a similar density to that
found in a winter forage grazing system. Irrigation was supplied during the summer
months at a rate of 15 mm every 3 days. At the time of sowing, a fertiliser mix containing
phosphorus (5.5%), potassium (14.7%), sulphur (13.2%), calcium (12.4%), boron (0.37%)
and molybdenum (0.02%) was applied to each lysimeter at a rate equivalent to 1600 kg

(UDB). A control (C) was used to provide background N2O emission data. All treatments,
including the control, were replicated four times. Following harvest of the kale, the soil was
wetted to field capacity by adding 10 mm of simulated rainfall. The UB and UDB
treatment lysimeters were amended with biochar (Pacific Pyrolysis, Table 1) at the rate
of 5 t ha_1, which was incorporated into the top 5 cm of the soil using hand implements
to minimise soil disturbance. The soil in all lysimeters was then trampled using cow hoof
simulation equipment designed to provide approximately 200 kPa—similar to the
pressure exerted by an adult cow hoof (Di et al. 2001). The surface of the soil was completely
trampled twice, to simulate the heavy grazing typical under forage crops. The
heavy trampling ensured the biochar was well mixed into the top 5 cm of soil, and an
equal degree of soil disturbance between all treatments. DCD was dissolved in water
and applied to the UD and UDB treatment lysimeters at a rate equivalent to 20 kg
ha_1, a rate at which preliminary work had shown to be effective in the free-draining,
urine-amended soil. Fresh urine was collected from non-lactating dairy cows that were
feeding on kale, and analysed for total N concentration. The urine was standardised to 7.0 g N L_1 and applied to all lysimeters, except the controls, at a rate equivalent to 700 kg

each sampling time, chambers 50 cm diameter _ 10 cm high were placed on top of the

These systems differed in terms of crop rotations, soil tillage,

The first cropping system was the standard reference system
(S1) designed to maximize financial returns, with emphasis
placed on the use of chemical herbicides for weed control.
Moldboard plowing was carried out each year during summer,
and herbicides were chosen in accordance with the recommendations
of extension services and pesticide producers that
must conform to the rules of application defined by ANSES
(French Agency of Food, Environmental, and Occupational
Health and Safety). The second system (S2) was an integrated
weed management system with no-tillage and direct seeding,
with a herbicide treatment frequency reduced to 25 % in comparison
with S1. The third system (S3) was an integrated weed
management system that allows for plowing and other soil
tillage operations when necessary, according to field observations,
for weed seed bank management. Herbicide treatment
frequency for system S3 was half that of the reference system
S1. The last system studied (S5) was a total integrated weed
management system with no herbicide treatment. However, in

Paper Waste Treatment:
Paper mill waste was applied at three different rates. The
waste was acquired from GB Papers Ltd, Guardbridge, St
Andrew, Fife in several batches and stockpiled in the field
without mixing.At Mackies field, waste treatments were applied to the previous
crop residues using a rear delivery manure spreader on
10 October 1994. This paper waste was applied at a 0, 12.7
(S.D. = 8.8) and 44.4 (7.1) t DMiha (WO, W1 and W2 respectively).
The distribution of paper waste was uniform up to
one metre from the centre line of the spreader. Insufficient
waste was available for complete application of both W1 and
W2 treatments, so W1 rates were located 2.5 m from the
centre line of the W2 treatments.

Cultivation treatment
We considered that the paper mill waste might adversely
affect subsequent crop yields, so we included the effect of cultivation
depth in the experimental design. We expected that
shallower waste incorporation would lead to the risk of N
shortage for the following crop, and that denitrification of
excess mineral nitrate might be promoted by incorporation
by deep cultivation.Three cultivation subtreatments to incorporate
the waste were applied perpendicular to the paper
waste treatments. Deep mouldboard ploughing (DP) inverted
the plough layer to about 350 mm depth, conventional
mouldboard ploughing (CP) inverted the plough layer to
about 150 mm depth, and reduced cultivation with a power
harrow (R) disturbed the surface soil to a nominal depth of
about 50 mm.

Crop residues, which may constitute 30-40% of the previous
crop dry matter, remained on the plots. Residues were
removed on small subplots of the WO and W2 treatments. In

were 1.6 t DMiha at 5.3O/0 N. In Dipper field, the measured

N), poultry litter +AgrotainPlus (PLA; 4% N), Environmentally
Smart Nitrogen (ESN; 44% N), Urea Ammonium Sulfate (UAS;
34% N), and Ammonium Sulfate (AS; 21% N), plus a unfertilized
control. All fertilizer sources were surface broadcast applied
by hand at a rate of 101 kg total N ha_1 (90 lb N acre_1).
Environmental Smart Nitrogen is a controlled-released urea
fertilizer containing a water-permeable polymer coating that
gradually releases N during the growing season, where N release
increases with moisture and temperature (Agrium Advanced
Technologies, 2013). SuperU is a stabilized stabilized urea source
containing urease [N-(n-butyl)-thiophosphoric triamide] and
nitrification (dicyandiamide) inhibitors that are uniformly
distributed throughout the granule during manufacturing.
AgrotainPlus contains the same urease and nitrification inhibitors
as SuperU (Koch, 2013). Poultry litter used in this study was
collected from a local broiler production facility and consisted of manure and a bedding material mixture (wood
shavings and sawdust). Poultry litter plus AgrotainPlus consisted
of surface broadcasting poultry litter followed by applying
Agrotain Plus (0.5 g kg_1 poultry litter) on top of the litter using
