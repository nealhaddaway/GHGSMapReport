With CT, the residue (Å3 tonnes ha_1) from the previous season's crop was left undisturbed over the autumn and winter period. Herbicide (glyphosate 3 l ha_1 of a 360 g product) was applied in January or early February to control over-wintering weeds and volunteer barley seedlings. The soil was inverted by ploughing to a depth of approximately 220 mm, generally in February or early March (depending on weather and soil conditions) from one to five weeks prior to sowing the crop (Table 1). The RTÐCC management system began with a shallow (approx. 75 mm) non-inversion cultivation involving one passwith a tined stubble cultivator (Horsch Terrano FX) from mid to late August followed by rolling to encourage moisture conservation and volunteer growth (Table 1). Following a period of two to three weeks, the area was sprayed with glyphosate (1.08 kg ha_1) and the mustard cover crop (cv. ÔRivonaÕ in 2008 and 2009; ÔSunshineÕ in 2010) was sown two days later using a cultivator drill (Vaderstad Rapide) at a seeding rate of 13 kg ha_1. The cover crop was sprayed with glyphosate herbicide in January to early February to ensure the vegetation had sufficient time to decay before sowing the spring barley crop. Both CT and RTÐCC plots were sown with spring barley in March with a cultivator drill (Vaderstad Rapide) Ñ the exact date depending on weather conditions and soil moisture content. The CT plots were rolled prior to sowing and all plots were rolled after sowing (Table 1).

 conformed to criteria set out in recent guidelines for N2O chamber methodologies (de Klein and Harvey, 2013). A week before the
 measurements commenced, stainless steel base rings were inserted
 into the soil at both sites, to approximately 10 cm depth. At the
 soil surface, the rings were fitted with a 2 cm-tall Ôwater-troughÕ
 flange. Otago site: On each sampling day, the stainless steel chambers were inserted into the Ôwater-troughÕ flange (25 cm diameter)
 which was filled with water to provide an airtight seal around
 the chamber. The chambers (270 mm in diameter and 100 mm in
 height) were insulated with polystyrene foam and covered with
 self-adhesive aluminium foil to minimise temperature and pressure fluctuations in the enclosed gases. The chambers were also
 fitted with suba-seal sampling ports that were removed at the
 time of chamber placement into the water trough. Waikato site:
 The PVC chambers (240 mm in diameter and 200 mm in height)
 were modified sewer hatches with removable lids fitted with a
 sampling valve. The Òsewer-hatchÓ rim had an internal half-turn
 locking system and a greased rubber O-ring, which formed a gastight seal. These chambers were also placed in a Ôwater-troughÕ
 base (23 cm diameter) throughout each individual measurement period.","After depressurisation, the samples were analysed for N2O concentration

A cropping system is correctly evaluated byaltering the whole system rather than individual parameters andlooking at the combined effect of this change. Accordingly, fer-tilization practices differing in both the level and the form ofthe fertilisers were applied in the organic and conventional plots.Thus, in the conventionally treated plots, a synthetic inorganicfertiliser was applied as base dressing before sowing at a rateof 120 kg ha_1N, 160 kg ha_1P2O5, and 160 kg ha_1K2O, follow-ing standard recommendations for conventional field-grown beancrops.

For spring barley, in order to ensure the crop N optima were reached, N application rates were 0 kg N ha-1, 60%, 120%, 180% and 240% of the recommended N rate. Following recommended practice (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010; Sinclair et al., 2009) and depending on the crop type, up to three separate fertiliser applications were made in order to reach the targeted application rates. So that the experiments were as commercially relevant to the UK agricultural industry as possible, the amount of N fertiliser applied at each application timing also followed recommended practice for that rate and that crop (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010) such that across the four fertilised treatments, at each split, the N applied was seldom linearly proportional to the final application rates. To prevent any nutrient deficiencies, overall basal phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and sulphur were applied according to site requirements following soil analysis, and applications of agro-chemicals were made as required to control weeds, pests, diseases and lodging.

consists of a thin, sandy silt loam topsoil containing about 30% stones. Below the

Cameron et al. (1992). Briefly, steel casings (50 cm diameter _ 70 cm depth) were pushed
into the soil in small increments, while the surrounding soil was gently scraped away,
leaving an undisturbed soil column within the casing. The edges of the soil column were sealed to the casing using molten petroleumjelly, to prevent edge flow effects. The lysimeters
were then installed in a lysimeter facility, level with the surrounding soil. The outside of the
lysimeters were back-filled to maintain the climatic conditions of the surrounding field.
The lysimeters were planted with the fodder crop kale (Brassica oleracea cv. Regal L.) in
January 2011. After germination, the kale plants were thinned to a similar density to that
found in a winter forage grazing system. Irrigation was supplied during the summer
months at a rate of 15 mm every 3 days. At the time of sowing, a fertiliser mix containing
phosphorus (5.5%), potassium (14.7%), sulphur (13.2%), calcium (12.4%), boron (0.37%)
and molybdenum (0.02%) was applied to each lysimeter at a rate equivalent to 1600 kg
ha_1. Lime, at a rate equivalent to 2500 kg ha_1, was also applied at the time of sowing.

the treatments to the lysimeters.",June,2011,October,2011,5,Multiple-intervention,"Nitrification inhibitor, organic fertiliser, biochar",4,"Four treatments were randomly allocated to the lysimeters on 29 June 2011: urine (U);
urine plus DCD (UD); urine plus biochar (UB); and urine plus DCD and biochar
(UDB). A control (C) was used to provide background N2O emission data. All treatments,
including the control, were replicated four times. Following harvest of the kale, the soil was
wetted to field capacity by adding 10 mm of simulated rainfall. The UB and UDB
treatment lysimeters were amended with biochar (Pacific Pyrolysis, Table 1) at the rate
of 5 t ha_1, which was incorporated into the top 5 cm of the soil using hand implements
to minimise soil disturbance. The soil in all lysimeters was then trampled using cow hoof
simulation equipment designed to provide approximately 200 kPaÑsimilar to the
pressure exerted by an adult cow hoof (Di et al. 2001). The surface of the soil was completely
trampled twice, to simulate the heavy grazing typical under forage crops. The
heavy trampling ensured the biochar was well mixed into the top 5 cm of soil, and an
equal degree of soil disturbance between all treatments. DCD was dissolved in water
and applied to the UD and UDB treatment lysimeters at a rate equivalent to 20 kg
ha_1, a rate at which preliminary work had shown to be effective in the free-draining,
urine-amended soil. Fresh urine was collected from non-lactating dairy cows that were
feeding on kale, and analysed for total N concentration. The urine was standardised to 7.0 g N L_1 and applied to all lysimeters, except the controls, at a rate equivalent to 700 kg

a gas-tight seal for the metal and polystyrene chamber used during sampling. At
each sampling time, chambers 50 cm diameter _ 10 cm high were placed on top of the
lysimeters for a total of 40 min, with three samples taken 20 min apart. Samples were
taken through a rubber septum located in the top of each chamber using a 60 mL

Harvey (2012), and Parkin and Venterea (2010). This method uses a gastight
chamber, which encloses a fixed surface area of soil for a given time
interval. The chamber consists of a frame driven 80Ð100 mm into the soil
and a headspace or lid that is fixed to the frame during sampling periods, but
removed at other times. Chamber enclosure is achieved by a sealed gasket at
the lower edge of the lid.
Chambers of 2 types were used during this work:
¥ Cylindrical chambers: these were 400 mm lengths of 220 mm diameter
plastic pipe, the bottom edge of which was chamfered on the outside to
facilitate insertion to a depth of 80Ð100 mm. Tight-fitting lids could be
installed during sampling periods, and these were fitted with a 4 mm
diameter pipe and on/off tap for gas sampling.
¥ Rectangular chambers: these had a 450 _ 650 mm base, 100 mm deep,
fabricated from 2 mm stainless steel to fit the removable head spaces.
The head spaces were 50 l rectangular white plastic crates fitted with a
septum for gas sampling with a hypodermic syringe. Head spaces were
located on the base by stainless steel lugs and retained by strong elastic
cords to partially compress a 12 mm polyurethane foam sealing strip.

management system that allows for plowing and other soil

Paper Waste Treatment:
Paper mill waste was applied at three different rates. The
waste was acquired from GB Papers Ltd, Guardbridge, St
Andrew, Fife in several batches and stockpiled in the field
without mixing.At Mackies field, waste treatments were applied to the previous
crop residues using a rear delivery manure spreader on
10 October 1994. This paper waste was applied at a 0, 12.7
(S.D. = 8.8) and 44.4 (7.1) t DMiha (WO, W1 and W2 respectively).
The distribution of paper waste was uniform up to
one metre from the centre line of the spreader. Insufficient
waste was available for complete application of both W1 and
W2 treatments, so W1 rates were located 2.5 m from the
centre line of the W2 treatments.

Cultivation treatment
We considered that the paper mill waste might adversely
affect subsequent crop yields, so we included the effect of cultivation
depth in the experimental design. We expected that
shallower waste incorporation would lead to the risk of N
shortage for the following crop, and that denitrification of
excess mineral nitrate might be promoted by incorporation

Cultivation treatment
We considered that the paper mill waste might adversely
affect subsequent crop yields, so we included the effect of cultivation
depth in the experimental design. We expected that
shallower waste incorporation would lead to the risk of N
shortage for the following crop, and that denitrification of
excess mineral nitrate might be promoted by incorporation
